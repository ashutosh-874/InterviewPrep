# Problem Statement#

# Given a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start time, insert a given interval at the correct position and merge all necessary intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

# Example 1:

# Input: Intervals=[[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]], New Interval=[4,6]
# Output: [[1,3], [4,7], [8,12]]
# Explanation: After insertion, since [4,6] overlaps with [5,7], we merged them into one [4,7].

# Example 2:

# Input: Intervals=[[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]], New Interval=[4,10]
# Output: [[1,3], [4,12]]
# Explanation: After insertion, since [4,10] overlaps with [5,7] & [8,12], we merged them into [4,12].

# Example 3:

# Input: Intervals=[[2,3],[5,7]], New Interval=[1,4]
# Output: [[1,4], [5,7]]
# Explanation: After insertion, since [1,4] overlaps with [2,3], we merged them into one [1,4].
